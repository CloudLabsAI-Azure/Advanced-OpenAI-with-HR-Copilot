# Lab 2: Understand function calling in Open AI GPT

Over the last couple of years, language models like GPT-3 and GPT-4 have demonstrated their immense power and versatility. These models have been successfully applied in various scenarios, showcasing their capabilities. While these models are already valuable on their own, the Azure OpenAI Service now offers an exciting new feature called function calling. With function calling, the latest versions of GPT-3 and GPT-4 can generate structured JSON outputs based on functions specified in the request. This allows developers to integrate the models with other systems and tools, enabling even more possibilities. However, it's important to note that while the models can generate the function calls, the execution of these calls remains under your control, ensuring that you maintain full control over the process. In this overview, we will explore how function calling works, provide examples of its use cases, and guide you through the steps to leverage this powerful feature in Azure OpenAI Service. 

To know more about Azure function calling, please refer to [Function calling is now available in Azure OpenAI Service] (https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-ai-services-blog/function-calling-is-now-available-in-azure-openai-service/ba-p/3879241).


### Task 1: Understand Function calling

1. Open **Visual Studio Code** from the desktop; next, click on **File** and select **Open Folder**.

5. In the **Functions** folder, open `config.json` and replace the following values with the ones you copied earlier. Next, press **CTRL + S** to save the file.

    - **DEPLOYMENT_NAME**: `Replace the value with the gpt-model name`
    - **OPENAI_API_BASE**: `Replace the value with Azure OpenAI Endpoint`
    - **OPENAI_API_KEY**: `Replace the value with Azure OpenAI Key`
    - **SEARCH_SERVICE_ENDPOINT**: `Replace the value with the Search Service Endpoint`
    - **SEARCH_ADMIN_KEY**: `Replace the value with the Search Service key`

7. In the new terminal, run the following command to install the required modules:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

8. Once the requirements are installed, close the terminal.

9. Open the `working_with_functions.ipynb` file from the left menu.
