# Lab 3: Deploy and Run the HR/Payroll Copilot Application

### Estimated Duration: 120 minutes

   ![](../media/copilot-overview.png "Technical design")

**Smart Agent: At the heart of the solution is the Python object Smart_Agent. The agent has the following components:**

  - **Goals/Tasks:** Smart_Agent is given a persona and instructions to follow to achieve certain goals; for example, HR Copilot is about helping answer HR/Payroll questions and update employees' personal information. This is done using instructions specified in the system message.

  - **NLP interaction and tool execution:** For the ability to use multiple tools and functions to accomplish business tasks, the function calling capability of the 0613 version is utilized to intelligently select the right function (validate identity, search the knowledge base, update address, create ticket) based on the agent's judgment of what needs to be done. The agent is also able to engage with users by following the instructions and goals defined in the system message.

  - **Memory:** The agent maintains a memory of the conversation history. The memory is backed by Streamlit's session state.
  - **LLM:** The agent is linked to a 0613 GPT-4 model to power its intelligence.

## Lab objectives

You will be able to complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Build your own HR/Payroll copilot locally
- Task 2: Integrate Azure Cognitive Search with your Application
- Task 3: Deploy the HR/Payroll Copilot application to Azure
    
### Task 1: Build your own HR/Payroll copilot locally

1. In the LabVM, open File Explorer, navigate to the below-mentioned path, right-click on the `secrets.env` file, and select **Open with Code**.

   ```
   C:\Labfiles\OpenAIWorkshop\scenarios\incubations\copilot
   ```

    ![](../media/img38.png)

    > **Note** : If prompted with **Do you want to allow untrusted files in this workspace?**, select **Open**.

2. The Visual Studio code is opened on the desktop. Edit the below code and update the **Azure OpenAI Key**, **Embedding Model name and GPT Deployment name**, **Azure OpenAI Endpoint**, **Cognitive Search Endpoint**,and **AZURE_SEARCH_ADMIN_KEY** values that you have copied and stored in the text file earlier.

   | **Variables**                | **Values**                                                    |
   | ---------------------------- |---------------------------------------------------------------|
   | **AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT**          |  Replace the value with your **YOUR_GPT_MODEL** name that is **copilot-gpt**         |      
   | **AZURE_OPENAI_EMB_DEPLOYMENT**          |  Replace the value with your **YOUR_EMBEDDING_MODEL** name that is **CompletionModel**   |
   | **AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT**          | **<inject key="OpenAIEndpoint" enableCopy="true"/>**          |
   | **AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY**           | **<inject key="OpenAIKey" enableCopy="true"/>**               |
   | **AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE_ENDPOINT**  | **<inject key="SearchServiceuri" enableCopy="true"/>**        |
   | **AZURE_SEARCH_ADMIN_KEY**         | **<inject key="SearchAPIkey" enableCopy="true"/>**            |

      > **Note :** If you're unable to see the full **Values** section in the table, click on the three dots (ellipsis) in the top right corner of your browser and try reducing the zoom level for better visibility.
   
      ![](../media/zoom.png)

3. After updating values, the `secrets.env` file should be as shown in the below screenshot. Press **CTRL + S** to save the file.

    ![](../media/img39.png)

4. To run the application from the command line, navigate to Command Prompt and run the below command:

   > **Note**: Here, you can enter your email address below to get notifications. Otherwise, leave this field blank and click on **Enter**.

   ```
   cd C:\Labfiles\OpenAIWorkshop\scenarios\incubations\copilot\employee_support
   streamlit run hr_copilot.py
   ```

5. Once the execution of `streamlit run hr_copilot.py` is completed, a locally hosted HR Copliot application will be opened in the web browser. 

   ![](../media/img17.png)

   ![](../media/img18.png)

6. Run the following query to validate the identity of the employee:

   ```
   John 1234
   ```

   ![](../media/img19.png)

7. Enter an example question such as `When will I receive the W2 form?`. The questions are answered by the Copilot by searching a knowledge base.

   ![](../media/L3-T1-S7.png)

8. Copilot can help update employee information, like address updates. For other information update requests, Copilot will log a ticket to the HR team to update the information. Enter `I moved to 123 Main St., San Jose, CA 95112, please update my address` in the HR Copilot app.
